//	The Inspection additions is included as a category providing additional inspection actions that can be invoked by long pressing the view, if the provided long press gesture recognizer has been installed on the view correctly.

//	Actions in the -newInspectionActions array and passing in or out of the delegate method -actionsForArticleViewController:basedOn: are all IRAction objects.  They need to be dynamically generated because they can be context sensitive.  If your code requires good performance and there is a potential bottleneck in generating them, consider caching them.
