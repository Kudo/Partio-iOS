ETReleaseNotes="- Revises the Data Store so for WAFile entities, Large and Medium subtypes are both retrieved, and the Origin subtype is selectively retrieved when expensive operations are available (determined by Wi-Fi location awareness)\n- Refactors some parts of the Data Store so the Overview is no longer “stale” and now updates instantly with changes in Large, Medium, or Origin sub-typed image blobs\n- Fixes a bug with the Authenticator where when the user was previously authenticated, authenticating again when the session token has been remotely revoked causes tomfoolery\n- Fixes a bug in the Composition view where image thumbnails might occasionally be clipped\n- Gallery now does less automatic global refreshes and the image views now flicker a lot less on file updates"
